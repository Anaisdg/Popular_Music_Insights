Chosen Topic and Rationale:

•	Measuring music artist popularity by country (e.g., top 5 most popular artists)
o	Visualization would be a Leaflet-style overlay map, displaying metadata on hover over region
o	Filter map results by genre, gender, and/or race
o	Possibly provide sales data of artist or genre
•	Sentiment analysis of lyrics by country
o	Optional filter by year to visualize differences in sentiment analysis
o	Possible scrape lyrics into db
