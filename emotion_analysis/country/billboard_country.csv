Bob Wills:New Spanish Two Step,"Down below the Rio Grande, a senorita held my hand And sweetly sang an old melody Without a worry or a care A rose she gave me from her hair And then she whispered, ""Si, Senor, Si""  In a cabaret we dance the hours away Her eyes told more than words e'er could say I told her I had to go, left her down in Mexico While the band play Spanish Two Step soft and low

Craig Morgan:That's What I Love About Sunday,"Raymond's in his Sunday best, He's usually up to his chest in oil an' grease. There's the Martin's walkin' in, With that mean little freckle-faced kid, Who broke a window last week. Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key in the pew behind me.   That's what I love about Sunday: Sing along as the choir sways; Every verse of Amazin' Grace, An' then we shake the Preacher's hand. Go home, into your blue jeans; Have some chicken an' some baked beans. Pick a back yard football team, Not do much of anything: That's what I love about Sunday.   I stroll to the end of the drive, Pick up the Sunday Times, grab my coffee cup. It looks like Sally an' Ron, finally tied the knot, Well, it's about time. It's 35 cents off a ground round, Baby, cut that coupon out!   That's what I love about Sunday: Cat-napping on the porch swing; You curled up next to me, The smell of jasmine wakes us up. Take a walk down a back road, Tackle box and a cane pole; Carve our names in that white oak, An' steal a kiss as the sun fades, That's what I love about Sunday, Oh, yeah.   Ooh, new believers gettin' baptized, Momma's hands raised up high, Havin' a Hallelujah good time A smile on everybody's face. That's what I love about Sunday, Oh, yeah.   That's what I love about Sunday, Oh, yeah.
