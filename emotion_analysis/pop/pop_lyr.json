burned out long before Your legend never will  Loveliness we've lost These empty days without your smile This torch, we'll always carry For our nation's golden child  And even though we try The truth

glad it was over  But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know  Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
